# Hawk Eye pipeline configuration.

# Can contain compute, draw, post process, and present in this order (draw is mandatory, the rest is optional).
Stages:
    draw:
        # Can be triangle list, point list, line list, line strip, triangle strip, or triangle fan.
        input: triangle list
        # Can be fill, line, or point.
        polygon mode: fill
        # Can be none, back, front, or both.
        cull mode: front
        # Can be clockwise, or counter clockwise.
        face direction: counter clockwise
        # TODO: blend enable
        # Can be any combination of r, g, b, and a.
        color write mask: rgba
        # Can be true or false.
        depth test enable: true
        # Can be true or false.
        depth write enable: true
        # Can be never, less, equal, less or equal, greater, not equal, greater or equal, or always.
        depth compare op: less
        # Can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.
        sample count: 1
        # TODO: the rest of the dynamic states.
        # Can be viewport and scissor
        dynamic states:
          - viewport
          - scissor
        # Can contain any amount of entries of vector types and integral types.
